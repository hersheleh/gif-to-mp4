Gif to Video

The Goal of this project is to create a web page that will allow 
the user to upload an animated gif and choose a target from one 
of the gifs frames. The target will be the image used for image 
recognition and experience loading purposes.

Once the user has specified a target, and a framerate the 
program will convert the gif into an mp4 file and allow the user
to download a zip file containing the target and the mp4 file.


I am using python to write this program. 
In order for it to work you need to install
ImageMagick


In order to split the gif up into it's components to allow the 
user to choose a target and subset of images. I run the
gif through PIL. I've written a function called gif_iter
which iteriates through the gif. 


In order to convert a series of images into an mp4 I use the following ffmpeg command:
			ffmpeg  -r 12 -i a%d.gif -s 640x360 -vcodec libx264 a.avi



Image Magick: Convert gif to individual images
						convert a.gif -coalesce animate_%d.gif


In order to get the number of frames in a gif.
I run the following command in python
a = check_output(['convert', 'a.gif[-1]', '-format', '"%[scene]"', 'info:'])

i = int(re.findall('\d+',a)[0])

print i

In python to get a list of the current directory you use

			import os
			a =	os.listdir(".") # the dot indicates the current directory

The above list will be out of order so we must do the following
to sort the list. Since we are using basename number filename schema
the following sort will work
			sorted(a, key=lambda b: int(re.findall('\d+',b)[0]))

To rename the new files we use the following function

 		os.mkdir('new')
    for index,value in enumerate(b):
				     os.rename(value, 'new/a%d.png'% index)
